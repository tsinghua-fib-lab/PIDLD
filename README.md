# PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics for Faster Sampling of Generative Models

This is the official implementation of the paper "PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics for Faster Sampling of Generative Models". 

Each directory corresponds to a task. Please refer to the `README.md` file in each directory for more details.

This is a draft version of the code. We will release a more polished version after the paper is made public.
